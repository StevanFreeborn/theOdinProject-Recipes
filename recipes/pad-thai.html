  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pad Thai is a Thai dish of stir-fried rice noodles with eggs, vegetables and tofu in a sauce of tamarind, fish, dried shrimp, garlic, red chilli pepper and sugar. Some of the ingredients are provided on the side as condiments, including red chilli pepper, lime wedges and peanuts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8 ounces flat rice noodles</li>
    <li>3 Tablespoons oil</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic , minced</li>
    <li>8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu , cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper , thinly sliced</li>
    <li>3 green onions , chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts</li>
    <li>2 limes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Fresh cilantro , chopped</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender. Rinse under cold water.</li>
    <li>Make sauce by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Stir Fry:: Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
    <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
    <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.</li>
    <li>Garnish the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
    <li>Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.</li>
